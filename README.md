# cljdekiq

Pronounced "clide-kick" is a client and server implementation of Sidekiq. This library is intended to be used along side a ruby app. Meaning, you can enqueue and run jobs from clojure, run jobs enqueued by a ruby app, or enqueue Sidekiq jobs to your ruby app. It all works!


## Usage

Sidekiq in ruby is a wonderful piece of software. It starts with you defining a `perform` function and extending the `Sidekiq::Worker` class to create a job system around your function. Feels very clojure-y!

Cljdekiq does the same thing. First, define your function. And from here you can start a server and push work.

```clojure
(ns my.app
 (require [cljdekiq.core :as ck])

(defn send-email [user-id] ...)

(defn main []
 (def stop (->> (ck/conn)
            (ck/register send-email)
            (ck/run)))

 (ck/perform-async send-email "user-123")

 (stop))
```

It's also possible to override any of the job specific information in two ways. First, you can specify relevant custom options when you register the job with the server. Second, you can use the `worker` fn to encapulate your default options.

```clojure
;; Method 1...
(def app
 (->> (ck/conn)
  (ck/regiser send-email :as "SomeRubyWorker"
                         :queue :backoffice)))

;; or...

;; Method 2...
(def send-email-worker
 (ck/worker send-email :as "SomeRubyWorker"
                       :queue :backoffice
                       :retry 2)

(def app
 (->> (ck/conn)
  (ck/regiser send-email-worker)

  ;; And you can always override options on your workers
  ;; when you register them.
  (ck/regiser send-email-worker :as "SomethingElse")))

```

Options

- `:as` -- Override the ruby-style class name used when creating or listening for jobs. If not specified, the function's namespace and function name will be used to generate a ruby style constant. Example: `some-lib.core/my-func` would become `SomeLib::Core::MyFunc`. Anonymous functions fail to generate a consistent name, so an `:as` option is required for that use-case.
- `:queue` -- Override the default queue. It is literally `"default"` if not specified.
- `:retry` -- Override the number of retries. You can specify `false` or an `integer` here. By default a job will retry `25` times.


Similar to Sidekiq, you can either create a job that is meant to be run _now_ or _later_. Let's start with `perform-async`.

```clojure
(defn send-email [user-id] ...)
(def app (ck/conn))

;; Rely on defaults.
(ck/perform-async app send-email "user-123")

;; Or you can customize the class, queue, and retries using the
;; worker function.
(ck/perform-async app
 (ck/worker send-email :as "CoolClassWorker")
 "user-123")

;; And if you just want to kick off a job to the ruby app, you
;; can provide a string clas name instead.
(ck/perform-async app "MyRubyWorker" arg1 arg2)
```

To create a job to run at some later date, you can use `perform-in`. It works _almost_ the same way as `perform-async` but adds a new parameter where you may specify the number of seconds from now until the job should be enqueued for processing.

```clojure
(defn send-email [user-id] ...)
(def app (ck/conn))

(ck/perform-in app send-email 30 "user-456")

;; To make the "30" a little easier to read, you can use some
;; of the built-in helper methods.
(ck/perform-in app send-email (ck/seconds 30) "user-456")

(ck/perform-in app send-email (ck/hours 1) "user-456")

;; you can also specify a worker or use the worker function
;; in-line the same way you did with perform-async.
(ck/perform-in app
 (ck/worker send-email :queue :backoffice)
 (ck/hours 1)
 "user-456")

(def send-email-worker
 (ck/worker send-email :queue :backoffice))

(ck/perform-in app send-email-worker (ck/hours 1) "user-123")

;; And of course, you can specify a ruby class directly.
(ck/perform-in "SyncHubspotChangesWorker" (ck/minutes 1) "user-999")
```


### Tasks

1. Abstract redis
2. Add sidekiq-rs optimizations
3. Middleware
4. Using `core.async` maybe
5. Sidekiq-rs crons
6. Dynamo/Firestore/Postgres backend

### TODO

1. Better error handling on json deserializing
2. Can we have shutdown support `(stop :timeout n-secs)`
3. Should we rotate the queue order on `brpop`?
4. How do folks use loggers with clojure?
